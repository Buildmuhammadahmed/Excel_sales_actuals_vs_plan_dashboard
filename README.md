## Key Formulas

These formulas power the dashboard lookups and variance calculations.

**Actual (for selected Year & Month)**

```excel
=XLOOKUP($C$4&$C$5&B9, Table2[Year]&Table2[Month]&Table2[Store Location], Table2[Sales], "")
```

**Previous Year (PY)**

```excel
=XLOOKUP($C$4-1&$C$5&B9, Table2[Year]&Table2[Month]&Table2[Store Location], Table2[Sales], "")
```

**Plan (lookup by Store and Month)**

```excel
=XLOOKUP($B9, Plan!$A$3:$A$13, XLOOKUP($C$5, Plan!$B$2:$M$2, Plan!$B$3:$M$13), "")
```

**Change vs PY (%)**

```excel
=IFERROR((C9/D9)-1, "")
```

**Change vs Plan (%)**

```excel
=IFERROR((C9/E9)-1, "")
```
